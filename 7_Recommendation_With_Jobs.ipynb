For instance, Courses dataset might list \"Python programming\" while Job dataset might use \"Python scripting,\" making direct matches less common. Therefore we made use of Semantic Similarity and set the similarity threshold of >0.7 to ensure that only skills with a reasonably high degree of semantic similarity are considered as matches. SpaCy's word vectors are trained on large corpora and encode semantic meaning, so a similarity score above 0.7 indicates substantial similarity between two skills."],"metadata":{"id":"QZk7Bldjopjs"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Example usage\n","user_id, user_skills = select_random_user(user_skills_df)\n","courses_taken_by_user = courses_df.groupby('Reviewer')['Course Name'].agg(set).to_dict()\n","recommended_courses, missing_skills = recommend_courses(user_skills_df, reduced_jobs_df, courses_df_unique, user_id, courses_taken_by_user)\n","\n","print(\"User ID:\", user_id)\n","print(\"User's Skills:\", ', '.join(user_skills))\n","print(\"\\nRecommended Courses:\\n\", recommended_courses)"],"metadata":{"id":"QlKyL_wD1Mm6","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"outputId":"99c7ee30-9029-4119-8ee3-f85f2f7c836f"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"metadata":{"tags":null},"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["<ipython-input-60-061c7138acb6>:20: UserWarning: [W008] Evaluating Doc.similarity based on empty vectors.\n","  any(nlp(skill).similarity(missing_skill_docs[missing_skill]) > 0.7 for missing_skill in missing_skills)\n","<ipython-input-60-061c7138acb6>:18: SettingWithCopyWarning: \n","A value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrame.\n","Try using .loc[row_indexer,col_indexer] = value instead\n","\n","See the caveats in the documentation: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#returning-a-view-versus-a-copy\n","  courses_df_unique['missing_skill_count'] = courses_df_unique['Course Skills'].apply(\n"]},{"metadata":{"tags":null},"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["2\n","User ID: sonia p\n","User's Skills: finance, decision-making, cognitive bias, behavioral finance, behavioral economics\n","\n","Recommended Courses:\n","                              Course Name  \\\n","274               supply chain logistics   \n","42             agile with atlassian jira   \n","97                     financial markets   \n","109  object oriented programming in java   \n","626   private equity and venture capital   \n","\n","                                    Institution  \\\n","274  rutgers the state university of new jersey   \n","42                                    atlassian   \n","97                              yale university   \n","109          university of california san diego   \n","626                           universit bocconi   \n","\n","                                           Description  \\\n","274  Have you ever wondered how goods get delivered...   \n","42   This course discusses common foundational prin...   \n","97   This specialization is intended for aspiring l...   \n","109  This Specialization covers intermediate topics...   \n","626  The course deals with the analysis of the priv...   \n","\n","                                      addressed_skills  missing_skill_count  \n","274  [warehouse management, material handling, stra...                   12  \n","42   [product management, product development, soft...                   11  \n","97   [financial analysis, investment management, de...                   11  \n","109  [programming principles, computer programming ...                    9  \n","626  [investment management, financial analysis, de...                    8  \n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Scoring Matrix (for 1000 Users due to computational cost)"],"metadata":{"id":"LoWfEGDQQDmB"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["In order to combine with other models, a scoring matrix is to be created.
